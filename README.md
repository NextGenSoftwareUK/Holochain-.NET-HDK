# Holochain-.NET-HDK
I have a strong .NET (C#) background and have created a .NET Client called HoloNET, which I will gift forward to this amazing community when it is fine tuned and made Open Source. I now REALLY want to create a .NET HDK. I would welcome people to join. 

.NET can compile to WASM so I know this is possible. If we can get this done I think a lot of people would find it much easier to create holochain apps as well as it opening up holochain to a much bigger audience and allow many more advanced applications of it. .NET allows us to build apps/games for Unity, both of which have a massive ecosystem and will help turbo charge the holochain ecosystem. This is why I am creating my Our World game with holochain, .NET & Unity. Holochain already talks to .NET and Unity through my HoloNET, but now I wish to help speed up the holochain hApp dev by creating a .NET HDK. Any tips to help with this would be really appreciated, I will create a Open Source repro where we can all contribute... many thanks! 

The first steps are what is required to create a HDK for Holochain? What are the API calls that need to be wrapped?
